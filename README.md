## E-Commerce Business Model

Roastin Coffee is a B2C type application. The site will sell directly to consumers in small quantities.

## Marketing Strategies.

The concept for Roastin Coffee is a small, local business offering various local produced coffee, therefore the budget for marketing is small.
However, for this type of business where word of mouth is of paramount importance, the obvious choice for marketing is through social media. This will allow the business to be promoted on local community groups with paid options allowing targeted promotion to particular groups of people. A facebook page was created and images of this you will see below. The creation of other social media pages such as Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn could also be considered.

To keep registered users up to date with changes to the business and new promotions, a regular newsletter would be sent out via email. This would also provide a platform for sponsor information to be distributed to registered users. Signup for the newsletter works through a mailchimp form in the footer of the page.
